# Hotel Reservation Cancellation Prediction 🏨📅

# Project Overview 📊

This project focuses on predicting hotel reservation cancellations using machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical booking data, we aim to develop a model that can accurately forecast whether a reservation will be canceled. This predictive capability can help hotel management optimize resource allocation, improve customer service, and maximize revenue.

# Introduction 🔍

Hotel reservation cancellations are a significant challenge for the hospitality industry, impacting revenue and operational efficiency. This project aims to build a predictive model to identify reservations at risk of cancellation, enabling hotels to take proactive measures to mitigate these risks.

# Data Preprocessing 🧹

The data preprocessing steps include:

- Loading the dataset.

Checking for null values and handling them.

Dropping duplicate rows.

Encoding categorical variables.

Scaling numerical features.

Combining date columns into a single datetime column.

Handling outliers using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.

# Exploratory Data Analysis 📈

The EDA involves visualizing the data to gain insights into the distribution of various features and their relationships with the target variable (booking status). Key visualizations include:

Distribution of the number of adults and children.

Time spent at the hotel (weekend nights vs. week nights).

Date of arrival analysis (year, month, day, and day of the week).

Services taken by guests (meal plan, room type, car parking, special requests).

Lead time analysis.

Market segment analysis.

Guest's previous experience with the hotel.

Average room price distribution.

Impact of lead time on cancellation rates.

Influence of market segment and repeated guests on cancellation.

Effect of booking timing (weekdays vs. weekends) on cancellations.

# Feature Engineering ⚙️

Feature engineering steps include:

- Label encoding categorical variables.

- Scaling numerical features using StandardScaler.

- Creating new features if necessary.

# Model Building 🤖

Three machine learning models were built and evaluated:

- Logistic Regression

- Decision Tree Classifier

- Random Forest Classifier

Each model was tuned using GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters.

# Model Evaluation 🏆

The models were evaluated using the following metrics:

- Accuracy Score

- Mean Absolute Error

- Mean Squared Error

- Confusion Matrix

- Classification Report

The Random Forest Classifier performed the best with the highest accuracy score.
